# Maven_Analytics_Superbowl_Commercial_Dashboard_Challenge
I have been seeing a ton of Maven Analytics dashbords all over linkedin so I decided to test my creativity with one of their datasets.
I donâ€™t think this is an active challenge, but I had a lot of fun creating this. It is my 1st attempt, and I used the Superbowl Commercial dataset. 
This is a single page interactive dashboard with moving gifs and text.
